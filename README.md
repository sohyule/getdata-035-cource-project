Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The R script 'run_analysis.R' assumes that the current folder has two subfolders **train** and **test** with their 3 data files (x, y, subject) in each, and two files **features.txt**, **activity_labels.txt**. 
"run_analysis.R", downloaded in the current folder will create tidyData.txt (180 rows, 68 columns) when run.

The variable names, and run_analysis.R itself are in CodeBook.md. run_analysis.R was just 30 lines and was small enough to be described in CodeBook.md
